# Switch-Theory-Analyzer

This is a python project based on "Logic and Switching Theory". This project displays the truth table if a boolean function is given and finds the minimized function if minterms are given. This can be used as a CLI application by running the "mainCLI.py" file or as a GUI application, built with tkinter & customtkinter packages, by running the "mainGUI.py" file.
